# DPN::Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpn-admin/dpn-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dpn-admin/dpn-server)

A Rails implementation of the DPN RESTful communication layer. The current
maintainer is [Bryan Hockey](https://github.com/malakai97).


# Installation and Deployment

## Dependencies

The project is built and tested with ruby 2.2.1.  Bundler is required.
All other dependencies are described in the gemfile.

## Getting the Files

```
git clone git@github.com:dpn-admin/dpn-server.git
bundle install --path .bundle
```

## Configuration

### Development, Test

The default configuration should be sufficient.

### Production

The environment variables in config/environments/production.rb must be set
under all environments.  We use [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
to manage these, so you can set them in a .env.production file.
See .env.production.example for the variables that are
required and what they do.  Before running any of the
```bundle``` commands, you should have these variables defined in your shell
environment.

If you are using Apache with Passenger, An example Apache virtualhost file is
included in ```apache-dpn-rails-example.conf```


You will need to precompile the assets. This will create a ```public/assets/``` directory.

```
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

## Database

### Development, Test

These environments use a sqlite database.  No configuration is required beyond
running

```
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

### Production
You should create a database for your environment.  The project expects a
MySQL database, and has not been tested with other RDBMSs.

The connection credentials should be defined in .env.production, but
config/database.yml offers more finely tuned options.

You should not have to create or populate the tables.  Rails will do this
for you, assuming you have populated the configuration variables.

```
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

## Storage

Separate staging and repository directories are required
(and specified in config/environments/*.rb). Pruning of old files
in the staging directory is considered environment-specific and
therefore out of scope for this project.  (We use find. You may
want something more robust if your bandwidth isn't "free.")


## Administration

In order to use the administration interface, you must create an admin user.
You will need to do this in the rails console in order for the user's password
to be correctly encrypted.

```
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails console
```

```ruby
User.create!(
  email: "you@domain.org",
  admin: true,
  password: "unencrypted_passoword")
```

The admin interface can be reached at /admin/

## Firewall

Each other node will need https and ssh (for rsync) access to your instance.

## RSync

To allow rsync over ssh, you will need to install each other node's public keys
in the rsync user's authorized keys.  Since this grants ssh access for a real
user, we recommend using a chroot environment and restricting the shell using
[rssh](http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/).

In order to get bags from other nodes, you'll need to mint a ssh keypair.  The
private key should be installed locally, and the public key issued to each other
node.

## Jobs

Various jobs power some of the facilities of the application.  They use
[ActiveJob](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html), which allows
you to substitute the job runner of your choice.  The default job runner is
[Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job), which makes use of
the "delayed_jobs" database table that was generated for you.

## Node Configuration

Nodes must be configured once via either the rails console
or the admin interface.  E.g.:

```ruby
Node.create!(
  namespace: "hathi",
  api_root: "https://dpn.hathitrust.org/",
  private_auth_token: "unencrypted_token",
  auth_credential: "unencrypted_credential")
```

### Identification

At minimum, you will need to know each node's namespace string and api root.  The
rest will be obtained when the project queries the node.

### Authentication

Authentication is handled via authentication tokens, which must be generated on a
per-node basis.

Authentication of incoming requests is allowed via Node.private_auth_token.
You should mint these tokens for each node.  You will not need them again
after storing them. A one-way hash function is applied to the token, so if the
authenticated node loses the token a new one will need to be minted.

Likewise, the correspending token used to make requests against other nodes is stored as
Node.auth_credential.  These are subject to two-way encryption.  These must be obtained
from each other node.

Note that for the local node, the auth_credential and private_auth_token should be the
same (before encryption).

## Running a Local DPN Cluster

You can run a local DPN REST cluster using the run_cluster script in the script
directory. If you have never run the cluster before, you'll need to set up the
SQLite databases for the cluster by running this command from the top-level directory
of the project:

```
script/setup_cluster.sh
```

If you have run the cluster before, and you have new database migrations to run, run
this from the top-level directory of the prject:

```
script/migrate_cluster.sh
```

When the databases are ready, run the cluster with this command:

```
script/run_cluster.sh
```

This will run five local DPN nodes on five different ports, each
impersonating one of the actual DPN nodes. The run as follows:

1. APTrust on port 3001
2. Chronopolis on port 3002
3. Hathi Trust on port 3003
4. Stanford on port 3004
5. Texas on port 3005

All of these nodes will have a set of pre-loaded data for testing, and each time
you run run_cluster.sh, it resets the data in all the nodes. In the pre-load data,
each node has bag entries and replication requests for _its own_ six bags, and no
node knows about the bags in the other nodes.

You can log in to the admin UI for each of these nodes at
__http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/admin__ with email address __admin@dpn.org__ and
password __password__.

You can access the REST API of each of these local nodes using one of the following
API keys:

1. APTrust: aptrust_token
2. Chronopolis: chron_token
3. Hathi Trust: hathi_token
4. Stanford: sdr_token
5. Texas: tdr_token

You should be able to connect to any node using any of these tokens. To test, you
can run the following curl command, substiting the token and port number as necessary.
Note the format of the token header.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Token token=sdr_token" -L http://localhost:3001/api-v1/bag/
```

You should see a JSON response with a list of bags. If you see a response that says
"HTTP Token: Access denied" make sure your Authorization header is formatted
correctly.

### Test Data for the Cluster

The test data for the local DPN cluster is in test/fixtures/integration. The YAML
fixtures are reloaded each time the cluster starts, wiping out any data from previous
tests.

There are also six test bags in test/fixtures/integration/testbags/. The bag entries
for each node refer to these six bags, and the bag sizes and tag manifest checksums
match the actual bags. There are notes in the YAML files explaining that final two
digits of each bag registry entry match the final two digits of the test bag names.
So a bag UUID ending in 01 matches the bag IntTestValidBag01.tar. The UUID ending in
02 refers to the bag IntTestValidBag02.tar, etc.

Also note that the first digit of each bag UUID matches the bag's admin node. So all
APTrust bag UUIDs start with 1, matching APTrust port 3001. Chronopolis bag UUIDs
start with 2, matching Chronopolis port 3002, etc. This should provide some cues
to help remember what's what when you are visually reviewing test results and log
file entries.
